Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Projects and Introduction

After Al Sweigart posted on Reddit that his Automate the Boring Stuff with Python was going to be free for 9 days, I hopped at it. I've heard many good things about this course and the book itself so I thought I'd take a deeper dive on Python and give it a shot.

I started to learn Python to try something new, as Python seems to have the advantage of a mature community and a large spread of libraries for finance and mathematics.
