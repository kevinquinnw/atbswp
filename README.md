Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Projects and Introduction

# Overview
After Al Sweigart posted on Reddit that his Automate the Boring Stuff with Python was going to be free for 9 days, I hopped on it. I've heard many good things about this course and the book itself so I thought I'd take a deeper dive on Python and give it a shot. 

Although I have some experience with Node.js, when switching front end to back end, I understand it is nice to keep context switching low, and using a framework in the same language can be beneficial. 

# More
I started to learn Python to try something new, as Python seems to have the advantage of a mature community and a large spread of libraries for finance and mathematics. 

I see myself branching away from web development as Squarespace, wordpress, and companies alike will generate a lot of static sites.
